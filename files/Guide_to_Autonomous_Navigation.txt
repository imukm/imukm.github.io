/**
*
* WHAT IS AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION?
*
**/

=> Autonomously navigating the robot
   simply means that the robot moves
   through the space on its own.

=> However, the Turtlebot does not yet
   supports navigating the space
   without the help of a map of the
   space.

=> Therefore, in order to allow the
   robot to navigate through the space
   on its own, we will have to create
   a map for the robot to navigate
   through it.

=> Mapping the course is a very
   important step. You have to be very
   cautious and make sure that everything
   is mapped.

/**
*
* MAPPING THE COURSE
*
**/

1. Run the teleoperation program.

=> Mapping the course is simply by
   teleoperating the Turtlebot
   through the course while running
   the mapping launch.

   Keyboard teleoperation:
   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch


   PS3 joystick teleoperation:
   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop ps3_teleop.launch

   Xbox 360 joystick teleoperation:
   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

2. Run the mapping program.

=> To run the mapping launch, we use
   the gmapping_demo from the
   turtlebot_navigation package:

   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_navigation gmapping_demo.launch

=> To allow for remote teloperation
   (without looking through course
   and robot directly), we use rviz.
   This also allows us to see the
   map that we are creating.

   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch

   Remember to enable the camera
   if you want to look through the
   space from the robot's POV.

3. Saving the map.

=> Once you are done, you can
   save the map by using map_saver.

   | $ rosrun map_server map_saver -f /home/turtlebot/mymap/map1
  
   DO NOT CLOSE THE GMAPPING LAUNCH
   UNTIL YOU HAVE SAVED THE MAP!

=> It is also recommended to save
   the map inside an easily accessible
   location (e.g. your home directory
   or USB flash drive).

=> Avoid saving it in a /temp or /tmp
   folder as your map will be lost
   after a reboot of the system.

4. Once everything is done, close
   everything, including the teleop
   launch.

/**
*
* AUTONOMOUSLY NAVIGATING THE ROBOT
*
**/

1. Loading the map.

=> Load your previously done
   map by launching the amcl_demo
   launch:

   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_navigation amcl_demo.launch map_file:=/home/turtlebot/mymap/map1.yaml

2. Using rviz viewer to autonomously
   navigate the turtlebot.

=> Launch rviz:
   
   | $ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch

3. Tell your Turtlebot its current location.

=> Set the current position of your
   Turtlebot by clicking the
   '2D POSE ESTIMATE' button on the
   rviz viewer program.

=> Click on the map at the location
   where your Turtlebot is currently
   physically located and point the
   arrow to where the front of the
   Turtlebot is facing.

=> This is a very important step
   in order to let your Turtlebot
   know where it is currently located
   in the map.

4. Navigating the Turtlebot through the map.

=> To tell your Turtlebot where it
   should go to, click the '2D NAV GOAL'
   button.

=> Click on the map the destination
   of your choice and point the arrow
   to where you want the robot to face
   to.

=> If you want to stop the robot before
   it reaches the destination, set
   a new destination at its current
   location.
