This will be the repository where we'll keep our files, etc. It is possible to create a separate repository for files, but it will be a lot easier to just upload all the files necessary here.

Files can be uploaded to the folder named "files". To make it more structured, please upload the files to the correct folders inside. If you wish to upload files under your name, create a new folder inside the folder "files", for example "Hakim" so that people will know it's your folder.
